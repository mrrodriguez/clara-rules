   if a \"Temperature\" fact is below a threshold, and the \"Temperature\" fact that triggered
   the rule is retracted, the \"Cold\" fact the rule inserted is also retracted. This is the underlying
   truth maintenance facillity.

   This truth maintenance is also transitive: if a rule depends on some criteria to fire, and a
   criterion becomes invalid, it may retract facts that invalidate other rules, which in turn
   retract their conclusions. This way we can ensure that information inferred by rules is always
   in a consistent state."

  "To be executed within a rule's right-hand side, this retracts a fact or facts from the working memory.

  Retracting facts from the right-hand side has slightly different semantics than insertion. As described
  in the insert! documentation, inserts are logical and will automatically be retracted if the rule
  that inserted them becomes false. This retract! function does not follow the inverse; retracted items
  are simply removed, and not re-added if the rule that retracted them becomes false.

  The reason for this is that retractions remove information from the knowledge base, and doing truth
  maintenance over retractions would require holding onto all retracted items, which would be an issue
  in some use cases. This retract! method is included to help with certain use cases, but unless you
  have a specific need, it is better to simply do inserts on the rule's right-hand side, and let
  Clara's underlying truth maintenance retract inserted items if their support becomes false."

     "Creates a new session using the given rule sources. The resulting session
      is immutable, and can be used with insert, retract, fire-rules, and query functions.

      If no sources are provided, it will attempt to load rules from the caller's namespace.
      This will use rules defined with defrule, queries defined with defquery, and sequences
      of rule and/or query structures in vars that are annotated with the metadata ^:production-seq.

      The caller may also specify keyword-style options at the end of the parameters. Currently four
      options are supported:

      * :fact-type-fn, which must have a value of a function used to determine the logical type of a given
        cache. Defaults to Clojure's type function.
      * :cache, indicating whether the session creation can be cached, effectively memoizing mk-session.
        Defaults to true. Callers may wish to set this to false when needing to dynamically reload rules.
      * :activation-group-fn, a function applied to production structures and returns the group they should be activated with.
        It defaults to checking the :salience property, or 0 if none exists.
      * :activation-group-sort-fn, a comparator function used to sort the values returned by the above :activation-group-fn.
        Defaults to >, so rules with a higher salience are executed first.
