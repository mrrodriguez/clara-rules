  "Creates an instance of FressianSessionSerializer which implements d/ISessionSerializer by using
   Fressian serialization for the session structures.
   
   In the one arity case, takes either an input stream or an output stream.  This arity is intended for
   creating a Fressian serializer instance that will only be used for serialization or deserialization,
   but not both.  e.g. This is often convenient if serialization and deserialization are not done from
   the same process.  If it is to be used for serialization, then the stream given should be an output
   stream.  If it is to be used for deserialization, then the stream to be given should be an
   input stream.

   In the two arity case, takes an input stream and an output stream.  These will be used for
   deserialization and serialization within the created Fressian serializer instance, respectively.

   Note!  Currently this only supports the clara.rules.memory.PersistentLocalMemory implementation
